<p>
  Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This
  groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid,
  incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of
  the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers,
  testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours— sometimes
  even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base.
</p>
<p>
  Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk
  delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for
  managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to
  support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance.
